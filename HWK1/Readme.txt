This is the first homework of the MVA course "Probabilistic Graphical Models". The goal is to coda an and analyze some of the basic binary classification algorithms: LDA, QDA logistic and linear regression.
The repository contains the following files:

-HWk_exercises: This pdf document describes the methods to be implemented and analyzed.
-HWK1 solution: A detailed theoretical description of the implemented algorithms and an analysis of its performance.
-classifiers: A python implementation of LDA,QDA logistic and linear regression algorithms.
-HWK1 experiments: A jupyter notebook showing how the algorithms can be used and its performance in different datasets.
