This is the second homework of the MVA course "Probabilistic Graphical Models". The goal is to coda an and analyze some unsupervised algorithms for clustering: K-means and Gaussian Mixture Model and to understand the basics of Probabilistic Graphical Models. 

The repository contains the following files:
-HWK2_exercises: This pdf document describes the methods to be implemented and analyzed. 
-HWK2 solution: A detailed theoretical description of the implemented algorithms and an analysis of its performance.
-Unsupervised_classifiers: A python implementation of K means ++ and a Gaussian Mixture Model.
-HWK2 experiments: A jupyter notebook showing how the algorithms can be used.
