This is the third homework of the MVA course "Probabilistic Graphical Models". The goal is to code and analyze the Hidden Markov Model with Multivariate Gaussian distributions as emission distributions. 

The repository contains the following files:
-HWK3_exercises: This pdf document describes the methods to be implemented and analyzed. 
-HWK3 solution: A detailed theoretical description of the implemented algorithms and an analysis of their performance.
-gmm: A python’s implementation of the Gaussian Mixture Model.
-hmm: A python’s implementation of a Hidden Markov Model via the sum product algorithm.
-utils: extra python functions to visualize and test the performance of the algorithms.
-HWK23experiments: A jupyter notebook showing how the algorithms can be used.
